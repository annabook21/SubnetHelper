# SubnetHelper

SubnetHelper is a Python-based command-line tool designed to assist in subnetting tasks. It validates IP addresses and subnet masks (or CIDR prefix lengths), suggests the closest valid inputs if necessary, and calculates non-overlapping subnets based on user input. 

## Features

- Validate user-entered IP addresses and CIDR prefix lengths.
- Suggest the closest valid IP and subnet mask if the input is invalid.
- Calculate the number of hosts per subnet based on the CIDR prefix length.
- Allow users to specify the desired number of subnets and provide non-overlapping CIDR suggestions accordingly.
- Explain the output based on binary math to help users understand the subnetting process.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run SubnetHelper, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Python can be downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

No additional installation is required for SubnetHelper beyond having Python installed. Simply download the `SubnetHelper.py` file to your local machine.

## Usage

To use SubnetHelper, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `SubnetHelper.py` is located. Then, run the program with:

```bash
python SubnetHelper.py
```
